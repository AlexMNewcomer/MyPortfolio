      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>
      I am a motivated security coordinator & general warehouse safety trainer at Saadia Distribution as well as a sales lead/trainer for Herr's Fruit Farm 
      with 4+ years of experience in security & 10+ years of experience in sales & inventory management. Since these fields are quite different from each other, 
      they've allowed me to gather different viewpoints & knowledge to enhance my abilities in a multitude of aspects. I'm also currently studying 
      software development at Rutgers University and will be graduating in April. Not only that, they've allowed me to recognize what I'm passionate 
      about & continuously striving for which is leading an organized & confident team to reach maximum effectiveness & proficiency for an organization 
      while maintaining the highest possible team member satisfaction.
